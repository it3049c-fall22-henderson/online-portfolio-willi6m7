## Self-Reflection:
VS Code and I are not friends. It wouldn't consistently let me see my progress on formatting, so I wasn't able to use CSS that effectively. I have also underestimated how long it would take to generate Github Pages.

### How long it took me to finish this?
Roughly two and a half hours.
